Here is a summary of differences compared to Joachim Gahl's script, upon which
this program is based:

* No runtime prompts for paths.

* Alternate udev rules directory may be specified on command line.

* Default action is `help`, not `install`.

* Checks for prerequisites (root user, Linux version, programs and directories,
  etc.) before performing any action.

* Requires that only one `fxload` program be accessible from standard paths.

* Does not examine content of udev rule file.

* May be run from outside of its own directory.

* Reports directories and files installed or removed.

* Has, and can report, a version number.
